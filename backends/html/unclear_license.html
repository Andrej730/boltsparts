        <h1>Why is the license situation unclear?</h1>
        <p>Usually this is because the author has not explicitly indicated under which terms he wants to license the material he provided. This is often the case when files are posted in forums and on blogs</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col">
        <h1>What consequences does this have?</h1>
        <p>BOLTS might not include this material when it generates distributions in different formats and for different applications.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col">
        <h1>What can I do about it?</h1>
        <p>Either contact the author of the material and ask him to clarify the license terms, or create functionally equivalent material yourself and give it a license.</p>
