	drawing with dimensions
	collection entry
	OpenSCAD base module
	FreeCAD base function
git hooks
upload to github
convert this file to issues
nicer layout for tables
nicer layout for collection/part/(standard) pages
all parts as step/iges/stl?


Generated HTML
--------------

automatic task list: short descriptions, check errors, missing images, proposed standards
Add Openscad incantation to every part, collection and standard
suppress empty properties
part page: author with mail
add total numbers of parts/standards/collections
tables in inches?

FreeCAD Backend
---------------

warning when superseeded standards are used
images
license header
http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/free-cad/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=4205&start=0
explore fcstd bases

OpenSCAD Backend
----------------

attach library http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30136
OpenSCAD parser to make base-args superfluous?
OpenSCAD GUI?
BOLT.scad: unified warning and error functions
add dimension checks everywhere?
zero coordinates for axis: cross doesn't work everywhere (see hex_socket1). dashed lines?
warning when superseeded standards are used
license header
NopHead assembly and bom mechanisms, or alternative bom mechanisms
maybe special mode for differencing (smaller diameter for threaded parts for tapping, larger diameter for hex traps, ...)

BLT
---

explore git integration (git repo url in collection header?, automatic updating?, submodules?)

spec: define concepts and use them consistently: dimensions or measures, base definitions, dimension lookup
spec: clarify and use consistently (repo, collection, parts class, part)?
spec: selection of discrete choices for parameters, for example the length of bolts?

Parts
-----

DIN EN number is 20000 higher, check if all DIN EN norms exist
aluminum extrusion
pipes
check out what the FreeCAD guys have already done:

Both announcements
------------------
legal stuff
drawings, ugly homegrown tools before discovering dimlines, long term doing them in FreeCAD is probably best
contributions!
very much proof of concept, suggestions, idea, criticism welcome
data comes from part vendors, can probably be improved


FreeCAD
-------

coming from OpenSCAD
GUI programming, base part scripting can probably be done better
possible to generate images automatically?
possible to use fcstd base parts?


OpenSCAD mail
-------------

inspired by MCAD and Nophead
orientation and positioning
diff mode
