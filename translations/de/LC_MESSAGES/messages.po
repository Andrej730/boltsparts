"The aim of BOLTS is to build a free and open-source standard parts library "
"for CAD applications. It does so by providing a common database that can be "
"utilized by many different CAD applications."
msgstr ""
"Das Ziel von BOLTS ist es eine freie und quelloffene Standardteilebibliothek "
"für CAD Applikationen aufzubauen. Dazu stellt BOLTS eine gemeinsame "
"Datenbasis bereit, die für verschiedenen CAD Programme genutzt werden kann."

"When you use a CAD software to create a design, this design consists usually "
"of two different types of components: Custom parts that are specific to your "
"purposes and have to be custom made (e.g. by 3D printing), and standard "
"parts like nuts and bolts that you can buy in a hardware store."

"A standard parts library relieves you from the tedious task of modeling "
"standard parts by providing them readily usable, so that you can focus on "
"the interesting aspects of your design."

"While many commercial vendors offer standard parts libraries with their "
"tools or for a fee, there is no free (as in freedom) standard parts library, "
"yet. BOLTS tries to fill this gap."

"BOLTS leverages the parametric abilities that most CAD applications provide. "
"This allows to obtain a huge number of different sizes and variants of a "
"part from a single model."
msgstr ""

#: website/templates/home.html:40
msgid ""
"Dimensions and metadata of all the sizes and versions of the part are kept "
"in special files. BOLTS can then use this data and the parametric models of "
"the parts to automatically build standard parts libraries (\"BOLTS for ..."
"\") for different CAD tools, that the user just can simply download and use"

msgid "So in a sense BOLTS is a tool to create standard parts libraries."

"In einem gewissen Sinne ist BOLTS also ein Werkzeug zur Erstellung von "
"Standardteilebibliotheken."

msgid ""
"You can help BOLTS by modeling parts in one of the supported CAD tools, by "
"adding dimensions and metadata for new parts, or by creating drawings for "
