"The aim of BOLTS is to build a free and open-source standard parts "
"library for CAD applications. It does so by providing a common database "
"that can be utilized by many different CAD applications."

#: website/main/templates/home.html:28
msgid ""
"When you use a CAD software to create a design, this design consists "
"usually of two different types of components: Custom parts that are "
"specific to your purposes and have to be custom made (e.g. by 3D "
"printing), and standard parts like nuts and bolts that you can buy in a "
"hardware store."

"A standard parts library relieves you from the tedious task of modeling "
"standard parts by providing them readily usable, so that you can focus on"
" the interesting aspects of your design."

"While many commercial vendors offer standard parts libraries with their "
"tools or for a fee, there is no free (as in freedom) standard parts "
"library, yet. BOLTS tries to fill this gap."

msgid "How does BOLTS work?"
msgstr ""

#: website/main/templates/home.html:39
msgid ""
"BOLTS leverages the parametric abilities that most CAD applications "
"provide. This allows to obtain a huge number of different sizes and "
"variants of a part from a single model."
msgstr ""

#: website/main/templates/home.html:40
msgid ""
"Dimensions and metadata of all the sizes and versions of the part are "
"kept in special files. BOLTS can then use this data and the parametric "
"models of the parts to automatically build standard parts libraries "
"(\"BOLTS for ...\") for different CAD tools, that the user just can "
"simply download and use"

"You can help BOLTS by modeling parts in one of the supported CAD tools, "
